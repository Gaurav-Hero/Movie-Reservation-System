1. forget to use dotenv.config and got process.env.PORT => undefined
2. type https instead of http and got my api not working ,beacause it dosent support secured connection 
3. while importing this line of code - import isDatabaseConnected from './src/config/db.config'; - beacause i didnt write full file name with extension db.config.js
