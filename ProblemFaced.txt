1. basically when we not use Content type: application/json in header section then express.json() will not able to parse the req.body 
beacause express didnt expect req.body a json untill you tell the express this gonna be in json formate

| -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| JSON gets parsed ✔️        | JSON gets ignored ❌         |
| `req.body` is available ✔️ | `req.body` is `undefined` ❌ |
